## The Robot (Slef)
Have you ever had methods in your class needing the 'self' input to access the object ? If so, we are absolutely sure you've at least misstyped it once. Which is what we did throughout the entire project. With the amount of times Emile typed 'Slef', we had to give this name to our robot haha.

## Mechanical Overview

- **Wheels:** Spike Prime wheels (56mm diameter, 14mm thick) for compactness and grip.  
  [More details](mech/README_mech.md#11-wheel-choice)
- **Steering:** Ackermann geometry, 3D-printed after Lego prototyping.  
  [More details](mech/README_mech.md#12-steering-system)
- **Differential:** Compact Lego-built differential for rear wheels.  
  [More details](mech/README_mech.md#13-differential-rear-wheels)
- **Dimensions:** Max width ~150mm, length 285mm for tight turns and component fit.  
  [More details](mech/README_mech.md#14-dimensions-choice)
- **3D-Printed Structure:** Three-layer design (base, middle, top) for easy assembly and access.  
  [More details](mech/README_mech.md#3-final-3d-printed-structure)
- **Custom Mounts:** Holders for servo, stepper, switches, camera, and stepper coupler.
